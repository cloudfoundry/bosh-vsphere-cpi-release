    # This field is used to resolve conflicts between security policies across domains. In order to change the sequence number of a policy one can fire a POST request on the policy entity with a query parameter action=revise The sequence number field will reflect the value of the computed sequence number upon execution of the above mentioned POST request. For scenarios where the administrator is using a template to update several security policies, the only way to set the sequence number is to explicitly specify the sequence number for each security policy. If no sequence number is specified in the payload, a value of 0 is assigned by default. If there are multiple policies with the same sequence number then their order is not deterministic. If a specific order of policies is desired, then one has to specify unique sequence numbers or use the POST request on the policy entity with a query parameter action=revise to let the framework assign a sequence number. The value of sequence number must be between 0 and 999,999. 
    attr_accessor :sequence_number

    # This field is to indicate the internal sequence number of a policy with respect to the policies across categories. 
    attr_accessor :internal_sequence_number

    # - Distributed Firewall - Policy framework provides five pre-defined categories for classifying a security policy. They are \"Ethernet\",\"Emergency\", \"Infrastructure\" \"Environment\" and \"Application\". There is a pre-determined order in which the policy framework manages the priority of these security policies. Ethernet category is for supporting layer 2 firewall rules. The other four categories are applicable for layer 3 rules. Amongst them, the Emergency category has the highest priority followed by Infrastructure, Environment and then Application rules. Administrator can choose to categorize a security policy into the above categories or can choose to leave it empty. If empty it will have the least precedence w.r.t the above four categories. - Edge Firewall - Policy Framework for Edge Firewall provides six pre-defined categories \"Emergency\", \"SystemRules\", \"SharedPreRules\", \"LocalGatewayRules\", \"AutoServiceRules\" and \"Default\", in order of priority of rules. All categories are allowed for Gatetway Policies that belong to 'default' Domain. However, for user created domains, category is restricted to \"SharedPreRules\" or \"LocalGatewayRules\" only. Also, the users can add/modify/delete rules from only the \"SharedPreRules\" and \"LocalGatewayRules\" categories. If user doesn't specify the category then defaulted to \"Rules\". System generated category is used by NSX created rules, for example BFD rules. Autoplumbed category used by NSX verticals to autoplumb data path rules. Finally, \"Default\" category is the placeholder default rules with lowest in the order of priority. 
    attr_accessor :category

    # Stateful or Stateless nature of security policy is enforced on all rules in this security policy. When it is stateful, the state of the network connects are tracked and a stateful packet inspection is performed. Layer3 security policies can be stateful or stateless. By default, they are stateful. Layer2 security policies can only be stateless.

This default rule is only applicable for the Layer3 security policies. This property is deprecated. Use the type connectivity_preference instead. WHITELIST - Adds a default drop rule. Administrator can then use \"allow\" rules (aka whitelist) to allow traffic between groups BLACKLIST - Adds a default allow rule. Admin can then use \"drop\" rules (aka blacklist) to block traffic between groups WHITELIST_ENABLE_LOGGING - Whitelising with logging enabled BLACKLIST_ENABLE_LOGGING - Blacklisting with logging enabled NONE - No default rule is created.
