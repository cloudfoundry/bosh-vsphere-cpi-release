Second, when render configuration is provided then the order of\n     evaluation is\n     1.

Finally, 'field' is evaluated only when every render configuration\n        evaluates to false and no error occurs during steps 1 and 2 above.\n\nIf an error occurs during evaluation of render configuration, then an\n  error message is shown. The display value corresponding to that label is\n  not shown and evaluation of the remaining render configurations continues\n  to collect and show all the error messages (marked with the 'Label' for\n  identification) as 'Error_Messages: {}'.\n\nIf during evaluation of expressions for any label-value pair an error\n  occurs, then it is marked with error. The errors are shown in the report,\n  along with the label value pairs that are error-free.\n\nImportant: For elements that take expressions, strings should be provided\n  by escaping them with a back-slash.

It can be changed only when there is no transport node in the NSX system. All transport zones in such a nested NSX system will have the \"nested_nsx\" property being true so that all transport nodes will use this MAC for the VDR ports to avoid conflict with the VDR MAC in the outer NSX system. When the property \"allow_changing_vdr_mac_in_use\" is false, it can not be changed if the current VDR MAC is being used by any transport node in a nested NSX environment. A transport node uses this VDR MAC if any host switch in the node is in an OVERLAY transport zone whose \"nested_nsx\" property is true.","default":"02:50:56:56:44:53","format":"mac-address","type":"string"},"allow_changing_vdr_mac_in_use":{"default":false,"type":"boolean","description":"When this flag is set to true, it is allowed to change the VDR MAC being used by existing transport nodes in a NSX system. The VDR MAC used by a host switch in a transport node is decided by the OVERLAY transport zone(s) which the host switch joins. If any of the OVERLAY transport zone(s) has \"nested_nsx\" property set to true, the MAC in \"vdr_mac_nested\" is used; otherwise the MAC in \"vdr_mac\" is used. Thus the VDR MAC being used by a host switch in a transport node can be changed in below ways. If the host switch is not in any OVERLAY transport zone whose \"nested_nsx\" property is true but is in an OVERLAY transport zone, the first way is updating the \"vdr_mac\" property. The 2nd way is updating one of the OVERLAY tranport zones joined by the host switch to set \"nested_nsx\" property true which will make the host switch use the VDR MAC in \"vdr_mac_nested\". The third way is directly updating the transport node to add an OVERLAY transport zone whose \"nested_nsx\" property is true into the host switch which will also make the host switch use the VDR MAC in \"vdr_mac_nested\". If the host switch is in some OVERLAY transport zone(s) whose \"nested_nsx\" property is true, the first way is updating the \"vdr_mac_nested\" property. The 2nd way is updating all those OVERLAY tranport zones to set \"nested_nsx\" property false which will make the host switch use the VDR MAC in \"vdr_mac\". The third way is directly updating the transport node to remove all those OVERLAY transport zones from the host switch which will also make the host switch use the VDR MAC in \"vdr_mac\".
