# SwaggerClient::LBFastTcpProfile

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**_self** | [**SelfResourceLink**](SelfResourceLink.md) | Link to this resource | [optional] 
**_links** | [**Array&lt;ResourceLink&gt;**](ResourceLink.md) | The server will populate this field when returing the resource. Ignored on PUT and POST. | [optional] 
**_schema** | **String** | Schema for this resource | [optional] 
**_revision** | **Integer** | The _revision property describes the current revision of the resource. To prevent clients from overwriting each other&#39;s changes, PUT operations must include the current _revision of the resource, which clients should obtain by issuing a GET operation. If the _revision provided in a PUT request is missing or stale, the operation will be rejected. | [optional] 
**_system_owned** | **BOOLEAN** | Indicates system owned resource | [optional] 
**display_name** | **String** | Defaults to ID if not set | [optional] 
**description** | **String** | Description of this resource | [optional] 
**tags** | [**Array&lt;Tag&gt;**](Tag.md) | Opaque identifiers meaningful to the API user | [optional] 
**_create_user** | **String** | ID of the user who created this resource | [optional] 
**_protection** | **String** | Protection status is one of the following: PROTECTED - the client who retrieved the entity is not allowed             to modify it. NOT_PROTECTED - the client who retrieved the entity is allowed                 to modify it REQUIRE_OVERRIDE - the client who retrieved the entity is a super                    user and can modify it, but only when providing                    the request header X-Allow-Overwrite&#x3D;true. UNKNOWN - the _protection field could not be determined for this           entity.  | [optional] 
**_create_time** | **Integer** | Timestamp of resource creation | [optional] 
**_last_modified_time** | **Integer** | Timestamp of last modification | [optional] 
**_last_modified_user** | **String** | ID of the user who last modified this resource | [optional] 
**id** | **String** | Unique identifier of this resource | [optional] 
**resource_type** | **String** | An application profile can be bound to a virtual server to specify the application protocol characteristics. It is used to influence how load balancing is performed. Currently, three types of application profiles are supported: LBFastTCPProfile, LBFastUDPProfile and LBHttpProfile. LBFastTCPProfile or LBFastUDPProfile is typically used when the application is using a custom protocol or a standard protocol not supported by the load balancer. It is also used in cases where the user only wants L4 load balancing mainly because L4 load balancing has much higher performance and scalability, and/or supports connection mirroring. LBHttpProfile is used for both HTTP and HTTPS applications. Though application rules, if bound to the virtual server, can be used to accomplish the same goal, LBHttpProfile is intended to simplify enabling certain common use cases.  | 
**path** | **String** | Absolute path of this object | [optional] 
**parent_path** | **String** | Path of its parent | [optional] 
**relative_path** | **String** | Path relative from its parent | [optional] 
**children** | [**Array&lt;ChildPolicyConfigResource&gt;**](ChildPolicyConfigResource.md) | subtree for this type within policy tree containing nested elements.  | [optional] 
**marked_for_delete** | **BOOLEAN** | Intent objects are not directly deleted from the system when a delete is invoked on them. They are marked for deletion and only when all the realized entities for that intent object gets deleted, the intent object is deleted. Objects that are marked for deletion are not returned in GET call. One can use the search API to get these objects.  | [optional] [default to false]
**close_timeout** | **Integer** | It is used to specify how long a closing TCP connection (both FINs received or a RST is received) should be kept for this application before cleaning up the connection.  | [optional] [default to 8]
**idle_timeout** | **Integer** | It is used to configure how long an idle TCP connection in ESTABLISHED state should be kept for this application before cleaning up.  | [optional] [default to 1800]
**ha_flow_mirroring_enabled** | **BOOLEAN** | If flow mirroring is enabled, all the flows to the bounded virtual server are mirrored to the standby node.  | [optional] [default to false]
