**resource_type** | **String** | The type of this resource. | [optional] 
**edge_cluster_member_indices** | **Array&lt;Integer&gt;** | For stateful services, the logical router should be associated with edge cluster. For TIER 1 logical router, for manual placement of service router within the cluster, edge cluster member indices needs to be provided else same will be auto-allocated. You can provide maximum two indices for HA ACTIVE_STANDBY. For TIER0 logical router this property is no use and placement is derived from logical router uplink or loopback port.  | [optional] 
**failover_mode** | **String** | Determines the behavior when a logical router instance restarts after a failure.
