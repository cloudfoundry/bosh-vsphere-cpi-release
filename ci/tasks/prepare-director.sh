# A regular expression matching the names of potential datastores the director
# will use for storing VMs and associated persistent disks. Note that the name
# of each datastore matched by this regular expression must correspond to a
# unique managed object across the entire vCenter (it is not sufficient for the
# datastore name to be unique across a single datacenter). Otherwise this error
# occurs during the create-env:
#   Found more than one VimSdk::Vim::Datastore: name: "isc-cl1-ds-0"
# For example in vcpi-nimbus the nfs-server serving the nfs0-1 datastore is
# attached to all hosts including those in the nested datacenter
# vcpi-dc-nested. Because managed objects are scoped to a single datacenter the
# managed object representing the nfs0-1 datastore inside *vcpi-dc* is distinct
# from the managed object representing the nfs0-1 datastore inside
# *vcpi-dc-nested*. In this case a regular expression matching nfs0-1 will
# resolve to both managed objects thus causing the aforementioned error.
