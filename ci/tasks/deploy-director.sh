# Proxy environment variables refer to squid proxy on Nimbus testbed jumpbox. We
# need these proxy environment variables because the CPI needs to talk to the
# BOSH agent on the VM it has deployed. Communication to the agent will fail in
# the absence of these proxy environment variables.
#
# In prepare director script, we use a proxy ops file to provide same variables.
# In that particular case, those variables are used to configure the environment
# for the BOSH cli, which rejects other environment configurations.
#
# Due to the different design philosophies between the CLI and the CPI, proxy
# environment variables are needed in both places.
